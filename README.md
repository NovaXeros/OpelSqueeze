OpelSqueeze
===========

Squeezebox automation for a Raspberry Pi and an Opel Astra.



For now, this is more or less just a place I can keep track of my own code. A folder on my PC isn't the greatest place to do that, and with history tracking and branching automation, why would I bother going for anything other than github?

If you've landed here somehow, please be warned: DON'T USE THIS SOFTWARE. It's buggy, inefficient, and the chances are it's not even what you came here for. This is literally just coded for my own personal use, and is more or less tailored to my own car's steering wheel controls.

If in the future I see some way of this becoming actually useful to other people, then I will update this README with instructions on use, and will encourage commits and whatnots, but for now, I really must stress you just walk away and pretend you never even saw this place.
